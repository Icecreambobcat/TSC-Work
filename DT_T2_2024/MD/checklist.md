| 16/8 - Prog update | Continued migrating background & research theory + completed additional background |
| 5/9 - Update | Targeting wrapping up 90% of the writeup over the next 3 days |
| 10/9 - Update | Clearly not done, and mildly off track, but come on... it's exam week. I'm working on the writeup right now |
| 15/9 - Fixups | Working on the writeup at the moment and trying to get all the boilerplate out of the way before the holidays so the entirety of it may be dedicated to manufacuring and prototype testing |
| 16/9 - Writeup | It's all in the name... Currently added some more structure though |
| 17/9 - Writeup | Ditto |
| 15/10 - Update | What can I say, the holidays were definitely not quite as productive as I'd hoped for, meaning that I've 5 weeks of work in 2 nights. |
