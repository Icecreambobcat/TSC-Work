## Background & purpose

### Context

Often a niche and relatively obscure genre, rhythm games have their own unique
allure that draws a specific kind of gamer. With keyboards being effectively a
native control and input source, it surely wouldn't be surprising that the race
for performance becomes a hardware development race not unlike Formula 1; the
hardware race is arguably the biggest driver of performance now, far surpassing
that of natural improvement even in top players. Indeed, manufacturers like
[Wooting](https://wooting.io) that were early to the now surging trend of hall
effect analog keyboards and switches have now dominated the market, by far
being the industry leader in software and hardware.

### Motivation

With capitalism, comes variety, or rather, the lack thereof. This isn't
unusual, given its only sensible to commercialise and continue the products
that bring in the most revenue and attention, even if the project has genuine
merit and purpose. However, as a somewhat regular player of these games and knowing friends that frequent these games, I've always felt there's been something missing. The custom experience. Unique, tailored, perfect, just to our specifications. {CONTINUE LATER}
