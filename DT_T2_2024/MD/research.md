## Background & purpose

### Context

Often a niche and relatively obscure genre, rhythm games have their own unique allure that draws a specific kind of gamer. With keyboards being effectively a native control and input source, it surely wouldn't be surprising that the race for performance becomes a hardware development race not unlike Formula 1; the hardware race is arguably the biggest driver of performance now, far surpassing that of natural improvement even in top players. Indeed, manufacturers like [Wooting](https://wooting.io) that were early to the now surging trend of hall effect analog keyboards and switches have now dominated the market, by far being the industry leader in software and hardware. With capitalism, however, comes variety, or rather, the lack thereof. This isn't unusual, given its only sensible to commercialise and continue the products that bring in the most revenue and attention, even if the project has genuine merit and purpose. However, as a somewhat regular player of these games and knowing friends that frequent these games, I've always felt there's been something missing. The custom experience. Unique, tailored, perfect, just to our specifications.

### Purpose

There is one purpose with this product: to provide uncompromising performance when playing these rhythm games, and to be fully customisable. We need a design that's both approachable for beginners and experts alike, without sacrificing quality or usability; the product should be designed without planned obsolescence or unsustainable practices in mind, instead being built for the user - extensible, modifiable, and recyclable or reusable at the end of its lifespan. While these are a brief outline of some details the product should fulfill, many more specifics can only be decided after an iterative design process. At the end of the day, the product is just a keyboard with a specific layout, but an extremely good one at that.

### Considerations

> [!NOTE]
> These are here by convention although much more of the standard format will be substituted for the double diamond design process

Of course, as a school project, there are time limitations among a slew of other things to consider - a few are listed here:
| Consideration | Justification |
| :---: | --- |
| Time | The proposed timeline for the project is 13 weeks - holidays included; project tracking and management will eventually be listed in an infographic (kanban/gantt) and pasted somewhere here. These time constraints are evaluated for the project based on other considerations mentioned here, providing a step-by-step outline for when something should be done and what should be done at any given point. |
| Cost | While there isn't a specific cost cap for this project, common sense should be applied to any spending for the project to maintain a "reasonable" level of realism for the project. Overbudget projects are undesireable for a variety of reasons, and being overbudget isn't a great look for the financial sustainability of the project, particularly when commercialising a product. |
| Tools | An understanding of available and feasible tooling should be a no-brainer for any self-respecting engineer, and given the outsourced nature of production and manufacturing for this project, industry standards should be applied to this project no less than they would be for a commercial version. A few reasons for this: designs can be physically impossible to manufacture, they can be highly convoluted and inefficient, etc. |
| Materials | Once again due to the outsourced materials, the only restrictions on material are external manufacturing limitations and the prohibitive cost of certain materials. However, cost shouldn't be the only reason various materials are considered; material strength, longevity, and comfort combined with manufacturing ease are all major factors when considering the specifications of a design. |
| Skills/Prior knowledge | A good knowledge of CAD and CAM/CNC is preferrable here not only maintain a common ground of skill but also to establish an understanding of the design process and its principles, where understanding the choices made in any given design would facilitate making the right choice in this design. |
