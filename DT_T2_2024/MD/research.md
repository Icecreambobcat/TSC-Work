## Background & purpose

### Context

Often a niche and relatively obscure genre, rhythm games have their own unique allure that draws a specific kind of gamer. With keyboards being effectively a native control and input source, it surely wouldn't be surprising that the race for performance becomes a hardware development race not unlike Formula 1; the hardware race is arguably the biggest driver of performance now, far surpassing that of natural improvement even in top players. Indeed, manufacturers like [Wooting](https://wooting.io) that were early to the now surging trend of hall effect analog keyboards and switches have now dominated the market, by far being the industry leader in software and hardware. With capitalism, however, comes variety, or rather, the lack thereof. This isn't unusual, given its only sensible to commercialise and continue the products that bring in the most revenue and attention, even if the project has genuine merit and purpose. However, as a somewhat regular player of these games and knowing friends that frequent these games, I've always felt there's been something missing. The custom experience. Unique, tailored, perfect, just to our specifications.

### Purpose

There is one purpose with this product: to provide uncompromising performance when playing these rhythm games, and to be fully customisable. We need a design that's both approachable for beginners and experts alike, without sacrificing quality or usability; the product should be designed without planned obsolescence or unsustainable practices in mind, instead being built for the user - extensible, modifiable, and recyclable or reusable at the end of its lifespan. While these are a brief outline of some details the product should fulfill, many more specifics can only be decided after an iterative design process. At the end of the day, the product is just a keyboard with a specific layout, but an extremely good one at that.
