## Background & purpose

Often a niche and relatively obscure genre, rhythm games have their own unique
allure that draws a specific kind of gamer. With keyboards being effectively a
native control and input source, it surely wouldn't be surprising that the race
for performance becomes a hardware development race not unlike Formula 1; the
hardware race is arguably the biggest driver of performance now, far surpassing
that of natural improvement even in top players.
