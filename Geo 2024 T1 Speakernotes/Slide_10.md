## Intro

<!--- jesus christ google add markdown support already --->
With all these potential breakpoints and an established premise that inaction will result in highly undesirable outcomes for many communities around the world, it’s without question that something has to be done. I’ll cover the current and future outlooks of the present tipping point, starting with right now: how’s the world doing? → {click}

## points

### worldwide?

- While Australia isn’t a nation directly associated with polar geography, it’s still a signatory to the **Paris Agreement**, an international effort at managing climate change conveniently relevant to our current discussion about arctic ice sheets
        - As arctic ice sheets are relevant tipping points strongly affected by climate change
- The paris agreement is an *international accord* adopted at COP21 outlining the following:
        - To control “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”
        - As well as pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
- (You may ask,) To what effect?
        - Being a legal (albeit dubiously binding due to int’l enforcement problems) agreement between signatory nations, this compels basically every nation (because 99% of nations signed) to submit climate management measures that average out to a *50% reduction in net emissions* (by calculations, not strictly)
        - As a “bottom-up” model, nations submit their own goals and attain them in their own ways → this places an emphasis on consensus building towards common goals
                - Consequently, specific goals are politically driven instead of set in stone

                - The following graph from the UN shows the predicted outcomes following various policies, not only showing the necessity of but also the undeniable impact of policies towards a greener earth

### australia

- {click} But what about Australia?
        - Australia has its own climate goals and ultimately seeks to be **net zero** by 2050
        - Current planning suggests that *by 2030* we should be *43% below 2005 metrics*
- As a long term plan, steps include but are not limited to:
        - Investment in public infrastructure and sectors to reduce emissions and/or break even on them
                - (dept. of) climate change, energy, the environment and water
                - Agriculture, fisheries and forestry
                - Infrastructure, transport, regional development, communication and the arts
                - Industry, science and resources
        - Reviews every 5 years to ensure adherence to the plan and adequate progress
        - Capturing carbon and sequestration from the environment
- Ultimately, being a long term plan means that by the times that these are at full effect we’ll be many years in the future
Thus, we may be unable to avoid these tipping points just through climate policies

### But what about us?

- Locally and individually, we can all make our contribution to global climate change however small our impact may be
        - I know it’s cliché but simply reducing our energy consumption and managing our carbon footprint can and will be effective if everyone contributes
        - Of course, this is more held up by political debates on whether or not the government can take out freedoms for “the greater good”
        - But we can always hope for a brighter future that we build together
                - We are all a part of Australia, and Australia is a part of the world
- Why is this here and not the next slide?
        - Because this is a key element of our current government, promoting more sustainable development and living as an answer to our current climate issues

### How effective really is all this?

- Honestly, not enough
- If we look at our current trajectory this barely makes a dent in regenerating the loss of sea ice already experienced
        - Therefore we need active regeneration practices
        - And I have a solution just for that on the next slide
- If we look at this too honestly who realistically bothers to listen to government initiatives and make it your shining idol
        - Exactly, almost nobody does
        - Therefore all we’re doing now is damage control
- So if we want to change for the better and not delay the inevitable we’ll need a more aggressive and direct solution

### stuff between slides

So now that we’ve discussed the current state of the world, let’s look at a comprehensive solution published back in 2016, and I’ll tell you why and how it would work, as well as why it’s the only path forward should drastic measures not be taken {click}
