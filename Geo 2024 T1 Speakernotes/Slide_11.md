# Notes

## A novel method to solve the above issues was presented by Desch J. et al. during 2016 in the “Earth’s Future” journal Vol.5 Issue 1

- Note that all diagrams and graphs in this slide come from the attributed article
- {click} Given that when we still had a reasonable amount of arctic ice everything was fine:
        - {click} And motivated by the fact that inaction by 2030 would mean an iceless arctic (santa goes swimming)
        - The proposed method would be to pump water back over the ice to artificially augment ice thickness and by extension area

### Why would it work?

- According to analysis provided by the source it’s calculated that approximately adding 1 metre of thickness to winter ice counteracts approximately 1ºC of climate change that would otherwise adversely affect the ice sheets
- The availability of space and renewable energy allows for a clean solution that is still technically feasible to implement
- The calculated cost for implementing across the whole arctic would be approximately 500 billion USD per annum over 10 years
        - About as big as the US automotive industry or the cost of the Iraq war → Expensive but not unrealistic by any stretch
        - As stingy as the US or any nation might be to spend this amount of money it’s of note that this is less than 1% of the global GDP
        - Yes, this totals out to 5 trillion USD, but just 50 billion for 10% of the arctic ocean in an all-inclusive setup from power generation to water pumping is highly reasonable and substantially effective at reversing short-term melting, with expansions potentially almost entirely reversing melting over the past few decades

### How does it work?

- Pumping about 1.3 metres of seawater onto the arctic ice approximately adds another metre of thickness over the winter
        - By artificially increasing ice thickness throughout the arctic ice sheets this can negate the consequences and even reestablish marginal ice that would have otherwise melted over the summer or be permanently lost
- This seawater freezes more readily than normal, being one of the reasons for this solution over the status quo
- {click} As seen in the above graph, sunlight absorption is one of the key contributing factors to ice loss
        - Additionally, more insolation means a warmer earth
        - So, adding more ice artificially or not means the ice will take the heat and melt away instead of exacerbated global warming
        - The independent variable in this graph is the days above freezing, while the dependent is the ice thickness
                - We observe a less-than-linear relationship here, suggesting that ambient temperature within reasonable ranges is much less impactful than solar irradiation
                - The black dots are the real data while the coloured lines are mathematical representations of ice albedos (rates of light absorption)
                - This can also apply in the other direction, where more ice means more absorption of solar rays from where it would otherwise be undesirable or non-conducive to our planet

### How effective would it be?

- It’s predicted that adding 1 metre of ice equates to “setting the clock back 17 years” and that “Implementation over the entire Arctic in the early 2030s, in 1 year adding 1 m of ice, would reset the clock to the present day, instead of the largely ice-free summer state one expects by the 2030s.”
- The sheer fact that such an implementation would turn back climate change on one tipping point on the order of decades is in itself a good enough reason to spend the money
        - Basically, we just turn back time and changed the future
- It’s the only correct path forward at this rate, given that different nations just resort to arguing over who should pay and who is responsible for what

## Conclusion and summary (if no one gets what i’ve said for the last 15 minutes)

- Ultimately, given current trends we’re going to have to do something about the preservation of our climate
- Currently, actions being taken are valuable steps, however are not directly impactful enough or simple infeasible to expand to such scales so that it would affect this tipping point
- Thus, we present a proposal to completely rethink how we can approach this
        - Yes, it’s on an order of magnitude as massive as the manhattan project
        - But it’s perfectly appropriate given the world-changing impacts and long-term benefits
- Basically, just go rob America for they money that they won’t give to climate change in favour of national defense and you just saved the world
- To quote the authors one last time, “What we do not have in abundance is time”, so go change the world
