## Consequences to nature

### Undesirable greenhouse gas and environmental toxin release

- The Arctic circle permafrost is a ticking time bomb, and should we let it go off (let it melt) all sorts of substances non-conducive to life can be released into our ecosystem
- One such potential hazard is the release of mercury and other once sequestered substances, poisoning and polluting the food chain as well as impacting the global ecosystem → {click} refer to first image
- Loss of arctic sea ice also drastically exacerbates arctic amplification → arctic amplification is the effect where the arctic warms up much faster than the rest of the world due to the rapid loss of sea ice and the comparatively low albedo of oceans compared to ice
- Arctic amplification is suggested to contribute to how the arctic has warmed fourfold faster than the rest of the world (Rantanen et al. 2022)
  - Sources frequently understate the severity of this as only twofold, which is a dangerous statement to make given the compounding nature of this phenomenon
  - {click} It’s clearly indicated in this graphic that arctic amplification due to sea ice loss is a substantial contributor to global warming
    - {analyse it however you want man or you can just move on}
- The loss of sea ice also removes the barriers for glaciers to flow into oceans and raise seawater levels (NSIDC 2020)
  - This is obviously bad in every way
  - Venice → gone (relatable)

## Consequences to us

- Why is this so bad for us?
  - For all the reasons that we say climate change is bad for us, this is also bad for us
  - Because it’s a substantial contributor to climate change
  - This can also uproot and destroy communities established upon the arctic trade
    - Potentially impacting an entire group of people
    - Even if they’re a tiny minority because the impact is so massive it’s still extremely relevant
  - The loss of local ecosystems can disrupt the balance many of our daily expectations are based upon
  - Particularly relevant in the case of these minority groups
- Long story short if this one tipping point rolls over the rest can and will follow suit
- Therefore we better do something
